# Google ADK Travel Agent - Complete Learning Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for learning Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) through building a complete travel agent system!

## 🎯 Learning Journey Overview

This guide takes you from basic agent concepts to advanced multi-agent systems by building a **Smart Travel Assistant** that helps users plan their perfect trip.

## 📚 Guide Structure

Each lab builds upon the previous one, gradually adding capabilities to our travel agent:

1. **[Lab 1: Basic Agent](./Lab1_Guide_Basic_Agent.md)** - Meet your first travel assistant
2. **[Lab 2: Tool Agent](./Lab2_Guide_Tool_Agent.md)** - Give your agent superpowers with tools
3. **[Lab 3: LiteLLM Agent](./Lab3_Guide_LiteLLM_Agent.md)** - Switch between different AI models
4. **[Lab 4: Structured Outputs](./Lab4_Guide_Structured_Outputs.md)** - Get consistent, reliable responses
5. **[Lab 5: Sessions and State](./Lab5_Guide_Sessions_State.md)** - Remember user preferences
6. **[Lab 6: Persistent Storage](./Lab6_Guide_Persistent_Storage.md)** - Save data across sessions
7. **[Lab 7: Multi-Agent](./Lab7_Guide_Multi_Agent.md)** - Coordinate specialized agents
8. **[Lab 8: Stateful Multi-Agent](./Lab8_Guide_Stateful_Multi_Agent.md)** - Complex conversations with memory
9. **[Lab 9: Callbacks](./Lab9_Guide_Callbacks.md)** - Monitor and log agent activities
10. **[Lab 10: Sequential Agent](./Lab10_Guide_Sequential_Agent.md)** - Step-by-step trip planning
11. **[Lab 11: Parallel Agent](./Lab11_Guide_Parallel_Agent.md)** - Search multiple options simultaneously
12. **[Lab 12: Loop Agent](./Lab12_Guide_Loop_Agent.md)** - Refine recommendations iteratively

## 🗺️ The Travel Agent Use Case

Throughout these labs, we're building **TravelMate AI** - an intelligent travel assistant that:

- Understands natural language travel requests
- Searches for flights, hotels, and activities
- Remembers user preferences and past trips
- Coordinates multiple specialized agents (flight expert, hotel expert, activity planner)
- Provides personalized recommendations
- Learns and improves from user feedback

## 🎓 Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of APIs and REST concepts
- Familiarity with async/await patterns (helpful but not required)
- Google Cloud account with API key

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Follow the setup instructions in the main [README](../README.md)
2. Start with Lab 1 and progress sequentially
3. Each guide includes:
   - Core concepts with analogies
   - Visual diagrams (Mermaid charts)
   - Travel agent use case mapping
   - Code walkthrough
   - Hands-on exercises
   - Common pitfalls and solutions

## 💡 Learning Tips

- **Don't skip labs** - Each builds on previous concepts
- **Type the code** - Don't just copy-paste, understand each line
- **Experiment** - Modify examples to see what happens
- **Ask questions** - Use the community resources mentioned in the main README
